# Changelog

## 0.17.3 — 2026-06-20

**Harden: `api_request` raises on unsupported `data` types instead of silently sending an empty body.**

The 0.17.2 bug was invisible because `api_request` quietly left `body_bytes=None` whenever `data` was neither `str` nor `dict` (e.g. pre-encoded bytes), sending an empty body that the server rejected with a confusing `400 "body is required"`.

- `api_request` now raises `TypeError` for any non-`None` `data` that isn't a `dict` or `str`, so a mistaken caller fails loudly at the source instead of producing an empty request.
- The two body-less POSTs (`promote-backlog`, `restore-backlog`) now pass `data=None` instead of `data=b""`, matching the helper's contract (`None` = no body).

## 0.17.2 — 2026-06-20

**Fix: `backlog-comment` now actually sends the comment body.**

`add_backlog_comment` passed a pre-`json.dumps().encode()`'d **bytes** payload to `api_request`. That helper only attaches the request body + `Content-Type` when `data` is a `dict` or `str` — bytes matched neither branch, so the POST went out with an empty body and the server rejected it with `400 "body is required"`. The command had been broken since `backlog-comment` was introduced in 0.17.0.

- Pass `data={"body": body_text}` (a dict) so `api_request` serialises it and sets `Content-Type: application/json`, matching every other POST caller in the CLI.

## 0.17.1 — 2026-06-15

**Fix: `view-bug` now shows the description, body fields, and screenshots.**

`view-bug` fetched only the project bug *list* (`/api/portal/projects/:p/bugs`), which returns a deliberately slim shape — no `description`, `steps`, `expected`, `actual`, or `environment` (those are omitted server-side because pasted screenshots can push a single bug body past 500 KB). It then read those fields off the slim row, so every bug rendered `(no description)` and any inline screenshot was invisible to the CLI — even when the portal clearly showed one.

- `view-bug` now follows up with the detail endpoint (`/api/portal/bugs/:id`) for the full record, mirroring how `view-backlog` already works. `--json` emits the full detail too.
- Inline base64 data-URI images (`![alt](data:image/png;base64,…)`) in `description`/`steps`/`expected`/`actual` are replaced with a compact `[📎 alt — inline png image, ~NNN KB — open portal to view]` marker, so the body stays readable and it's obvious a screenshot exists without dumping hundreds of KB of base64 to the terminal.
- `view-backlog` gets the same image-stripping treatment (it already fetched the full detail, but printed raw base64 if an item had a pasted screenshot).
- Falls back to metadata-only (with a stderr note) if the detail fetch fails.

## 0.17.0 — 2026-06-05

**Feat: surface backlog descriptions + close the gap between CLI and backend.**

The CLI used to print backlog items as title + status only — no description, no comments, no way to read what a `#N` actually meant before implementing it. The backend had richer routes (`/backlog/:id/comments`, `/promote`, `/restore`, generic attachments) that were simply not wired into the CLI.

New subcommands:

- `view-backlog <project> <#N>` — full description, parent, children (for epics), and comments via `/api/portal/projects/:p/backlog/by-number/:n`
- `backlog-comment` / `backlog-comments` / `delete-backlog-comment` — mirror of bug-comment CRUD for backlog items
- `promote-backlog <project> <#N>` — promote a backlog item to a feature (server creates the feature, seeds a `spec.md` quick-spec, links the item)
- `restore-backlog <project> <uuid>` — restore a soft-deleted item (internal only)
- `delete-bug <project> <#N>` — soft-delete a bug (internal only)
- `list-attachments <feature|bug|backlog> <uuid>` — list attached files on any entity
- `download-attachment <id> <out-path>` — fetch a single attachment's bytes (the `pull` command is whole-project; this is the targeted variant)
- `delete-attachment <id>` — remove an attachment
- `attach <file> --bug <project> <#N>` / `--backlog <project> <#N>` — `attach` previously only targeted features; now it accepts bug and backlog targets too (the backend already supported `entityType: bug|backlog` on `/api/portal/attachments`)

Extended:

- `backlog-update --epic true|false` — flip the epic flag on an existing item (server-side constraints: epics must be top-level, can't toggle if the item has children, can't demote-with-children)

Backwards-compatible: every existing command behaves identically. Slash commands added for each new subcommand.

## 0.16.7 — 2026-05-28

**Fix: `find_project_root()` now works from inside symlinked trees.**

`config.find_project_root()` previously started from `os.getcwd()`, which on macOS returns the symlink-resolved path. When cwd was inside a symlinked tree like Cortex's `awolve-context/` (which points into SharePoint), walking up never crossed back into the actual repo where `.claude/specs.md` lives — so `read_config()` returned `None` and every `specs-cli.py` invocation failed silently with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`.

Patch tries `$PWD` (shell-tracked, preserves symlinks) before falling back to `os.getcwd()`. Both starts are walked, so behavior is unchanged when `$PWD` is unset, missing, or already resolved.

## 0.16.6 — 2026-05-16

**Fix (specs-plugin bug #2, Option 2): skip push + writeback when body content hasn't changed.**

`push()` now hashes the (frontmatter-stripped) body and compares to the frontmatter's `last_synced_hash`. If they match, the server already has this exact content — return early, no HTTP call, no `atomic_write` rewrite. Every Edit on a spec file no longer guarantees a OneDrive-visible filesystem event; only Edits that actually change body content do.

Why this matters: the unconditional writeback was a major source of OneDrive `.remote` conflict copies on collaboratively-edited specs (14 on `studyalong-genai/033-vikariehantering`, 12 on `037-utbetalningsregler` in the May audit). This patch addresses Pattern A (same-machine churn from multi-Edit Claude tasks or formatter-style rewrites). Pattern B (cross-machine concurrent edits) remains — if `.remote` files keep appearing on the active specs after a week, escalate to Option 4 (auto-pull-and-rebase on 409) per the bug's recommended sequence.

Smoke-test: pushing an unchanged spec is now a true no-op (zero stdout, exit 0, mtime + inode unchanged).

## 0.16.5 — 2026-05-14

**Fix (bug #12): add `set-title` so feature display titles can be edited without renaming the slug.**

New subcommand `set-title <feature-id> <text>` updates a feature's display title alone via `PATCH /api/features/lookup?id=...`. Mirrors the existing `set-description` shape. The backend route already supported title-only updates; this just closes the CLI gap that bug #12 flagged.

When to use which:
- `rename-feature` — slug *and* title change together (e.g. you got the slug wrong)
- `set-title` — slug is fine, just touch up the human-readable name (e.g. fix the every-word-capitalized output of the auto-derivation)
- `set-description` — short summary
- `set-status` — feature/document status

New slash command `/awolve-spec:set-title`. help.md + SKILL.md updated.

The bug's other concern — "rename-feature only updates slug, not display name" — was already addressed by v0.15.3 (sends title alongside name) + spec-service v0.22.x (accepts title on rename). Live-verified during this fix.

## 0.16.4 — 2026-05-14

**Fix (paired with spec-service v0.25.2 / bug #16): clearer error when a local project isn't registered server-side.**

When `bug` or `backlog-add` hits a project that the spec service doesn't know about (e.g. it's in your local `projects.md` but was never bootstrapped), the server now returns `404 project_not_found` instead of a generic 500. The CLI surfaces this with a multi-line explanation pointing at `scripts/bootstrap-specs.py` and `GET /api/portal/projects` for the canonical list — so a Mattias-style "regardless of payload, it 500s" report won't recur.

Requires spec-service v0.25.2.

## 0.16.3 — 2026-05-13

**Feature: edit and delete comments from the CLI, with full audit coverage.**

- New subcommand `edit-comment <comment-id> <body>` edits a spec-doc comment. Author-only on the server.
- New subcommand `delete-comment <comment-id>` deletes a spec-doc comment. Author-only, hard delete.
- New subcommand `edit-bug-comment <project> <#N> <comment-id> <body>` edits a bug comment. Author OR any internal user.
- New subcommand `delete-bug-comment <project> <#N> <comment-id>` deletes a bug comment. Author OR any internal user, hard delete.
- `bug-comments` listing now shows the comment UUID in brackets so users can copy it into edit/delete commands without going to the portal.
- New slash commands `/awolve-spec:edit-comment`, `/awolve-spec:delete-comment`, `/awolve-spec:edit-bug-comment`, `/awolve-spec:delete-bug-comment`. Delete commands instruct Claude to confirm with the user first.

Every body edit is now audited:
- Bug comments — `bug_comment.update` audit event (already existed; CLI just exposes it).
- Spec-doc comments — `comment.update` audit event. Previously body edits were silent on the doc side. **Requires spec-service v0.25.1**, which adds the audit event with a 100-char preview of the previous body in `metadata.previousBodyExcerpt`.

## 0.16.2 — 2026-05-13

**Fix (bug #15): bugs can now be edited and commented on from the CLI.**

- New subcommand `update-bug <project> <bug-number> [--title T] [--description T] [--severity S]` patches title/description/severity on an existing bug. At least one flag required. Status changes still go via `set-bug-status` so the audit log gets a dedicated `status_change` event.
- New subcommand `bug-comment <project> <bug-number> <body>` adds a comment to a bug — for attaching commit SHAs, package versions, or rollout notes without rewriting the original report.
- New subcommand `bug-comments <project> <bug-number> [--json]` lists the comment thread (oldest-first), with author + author type + timestamp on each entry.
- New slash commands `/awolve-spec:update-bug`, `/awolve-spec:bug-comment`, `/awolve-spec:bug-comments`. Shapes mirror the existing `backlog-update` / `comment` / `comments` commands so the two flows feel consistent.
- SKILL.md reference table and `/awolve-spec:help` updated.

No spec-service version bump required — backend PATCH `/api/portal/bugs/:id` and POST `/api/portal/bugs/:id/comments` already exist.

## 0.16.1 — 2026-04-28

**Fix (bug #14): backlog items can now be edited and deleted from the CLI.**

- New subcommand `backlog-update <project> <item> [--title T] [--description T] [--priority P] [--status S]` patches fields on an existing item. At least one flag required. Parent/epic changes still go via `backlog-set-parent`.
- New subcommand `backlog-delete <project> <item>` soft-deletes an item. If the item is an epic, the server cascades to all active children in one transaction. The portal already exposes both affordances; this closes the CLI gap.
- New slash commands `/awolve-spec:backlog-update` and `/awolve-spec:backlog-delete`. The delete command instructs Claude to confirm with the user before calling — destructive and visible in the audit log.
- SKILL.md reference table updated.

## 0.16.0 — 2026-04-22

**Feature (spec 013): backlog hierarchy + filters + epic flag.**

- `backlog-add` accepts `--parent <id-or-#N>` to create the item as a child of an existing epic, and `--epic` to create the item as an empty epic placeholder. Mutually exclusive.
- New subcommand `backlog-set-parent <project> <item> <parent|none>` reparents an item; `none` clears the parent. Wraps the existing PATCH endpoint.
- New slash command `/awolve-spec:backlog-set-parent`.
- `backlog` list gains `--epics` (filter to `isEpic = true`), `--flat`, `--status`, `--priority`. Default is now a tree view with epic head + indented children. Epic rows are prefixed with `[EPIC]` and show a child-status histogram inline; empty epics show `· (no items yet)`.
- All numeric `#N` references resolve server-side and report a clear error when the parent isn't an epic (`parent_not_an_epic`), still has its own children (`epic_has_children`), etc.
- SKILL.md gains a "Backlog hierarchy" section guiding Claude to propose an epic when the user is adding multiple related items in one session.

Requires spec-service v0.25.0 (adds `is_epic` column + parent validation).

## 0.15.3 — 2026-04-16

- **Fix (bug #9): set-status refuses ambiguous bare feature names.** When a feature name like `001-base-infrastructure` exists in multiple projects, `set-status` previously silently updated the first match — wrong project, no warning. Now collects all matches first and errors with: `feature name '...' exists in multiple projects: ..., ... — use <project>/<feature> form`. The qualified form (`project/feature-name`) was already supported and continues to work.
- **Fix (bug #6): rename-feature now updates the title field.** Previously only patched `name` (slug), leaving the portal showing the old human-readable title. Now derives a title from the new slug (strip numeric prefix, title-case) and sends both `name` and `title` in the PATCH. Pass `--title "Custom Title"` to override the derivation.
- **Fix (bug #8): attach replaces existing attachment with the same filename.** Previously re-uploading the same file created a duplicate row. Now checks existing attachments for the feature, and if one with the same filename exists, deletes it before uploading the replacement. Best-effort — if the check fails, upload still proceeds (may still duplicate).

## 0.15.2 — 2026-04-15

- New subcommand `set-bug-status <project-id> <bug-number> <status>` — change a bug's status from the CLI. Previously the only way to close a resolved bug was via the portal UI or a manual PATCH to the API.
- New slash command `/awolve-spec:set-bug-status`.
- SKILL.md reference table updated.

## 0.15.1 — 2026-04-15

- New subcommand `view-bug <project-id> <bug-number> [--json]` — fetch full bug details (description, severity, repro). Previously there was no way to read a bug's body without opening the portal or curling the API.
- New slash command `/awolve-spec:view-bug` — Claude-facing wrapper.
- SKILL.md now includes a full `specs-cli.py` subcommand reference so Claude doesn't have to grep the script source to discover the command surface. Also documents two sharp edges: `create-feature` rejects numeric prefixes (service auto-numbers), and `--json` is available on several list commands.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-04-13

**Feature shortDescription from the CLI.** Companion to spec-service v0.21.1 which fixed the PATCH route.

- `create-feature` learned `--description "<text>"` — sets the feature's shortDescription immediately after creation (via a follow-up PATCH to `/api/features/lookup`, since the POST endpoint doesn't accept the field yet).
- New subcommand `set-description <feature-id> <text>` — update or clear an existing feature's shortDescription. Pass `""` to clear.
- New slash command `/awolve-spec:set-description` — Claude-facing wrapper.
- Requires spec-service v0.21.1 or later (earlier versions silently drop `short_description` on the lookup PATCH).

## 0.14.3 — 2026-04-13
- `create-feature` now sends the spec number explicitly to the service as `number` in the POST body, derived from the folder name prefix. The service also accepts the prefix implicitly, but sending it explicitly keeps CLI and service consistent when the name already has a number.
- Requires spec-service v0.20.0 or later (earlier versions ignore the `number` field).

## 0.14.2 — 2026-04-12

- **New slash command `/awolve-spec:update-plugins`** — refreshes the `awolve-open-claude-plugins` marketplace and prompts the user to run `/reload-plugins`. Counterpart to `/update-awolve-plugins` (which covers `awolve-marketplace`). `/cortex-update` runs both.

## 0.14.1 — 2026-04-12

- **`specs log --all`** — query the audit feed across every configured project, merged and sorted by time. Events get a project-id prefix so the output stays legible. Makes "what happened yesterday" answerable without picking a project.
  ```bash
  specs log --all --since 1d
  specs log --all --since 7d --author bjorn.allvin@awolve.ai
  specs log --all --since-last-visit --mark-read   # advances cursor per project
  ```
  Works alongside the per-project form — pass either a project id or `--all`, not both.
- **New slash command `/awolve-spec:log`** — Claude-facing interface to the CLI that maps natural-language questions ("what happened yesterday", "did Michael do anything today", "any new bugs this week") to the right flags, runs the command, and summarizes the output with grouped bullet points per project. Advances the visit cursor when appropriate.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-04-12

**Robust pull + `specs log` command** (spec 010 phases 3b + 4, plugin side). Companion to spec-service v0.18.0 which shipped the `/changes` and `/history` endpoints.

### Pull robustness

- **Atomic writes** — every file write (.md docs and binary attachments) goes through a tempfile → fsync → os.replace. A crash mid-write can never leave a half-written file in your specs folder.
- **HTTP retries** — `api_request()` now retries transient failures:
  - GET: 3 attempts for 502/503/504 and `ConnectionError`, exponential backoff (0.5s → 1s → 2s) with ±25% jitter.
  - Mutating methods (PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE): 1 retry for `ConnectionError` only, and only if the error happened before the request was sent. Never retry on HTTPError — we trust any status the server actually returned.
  - 401 and 409 are never retried (they're semantic signals).
- **Drift detection via `last_synced_hash`** — every synced file now carries a `last_synced_hash` frontmatter field recording the body hash the client last saw from the server. On subsequent pulls, if the local hash differs from `last_synced_hash` AND the remote hash has also changed, the pull writes the remote content to `<file>.remote` and leaves the local file untouched. The pull summary reports conflicts so you can review and reconcile them manually.
- **`push()` sets `last_synced_hash`** after a successful push so the new value is consistent — a subsequent pull will treat the just-pushed version as "clean".
- **Deletion handling** — when a local file's `spec_doc_id` isn't in the remote manifest (feature or document was deleted in the portal), `pull` moves the local file into `.specs-trash/YYYY-MM-DD/<relative-path>` by default. Three flags control this:
  - `pull --prune` — permanently delete instead of trashing
  - `pull --keep` — leave orphans alone (previous default behavior)
  - `pull` (default) — trash, recoverable
  Collisions in the trash get a numeric suffix so nothing is ever overwritten.

### State file

- New per-project state file at `.claude/specs.state.json` tracking sync and visit cursors across pulls. Shape:
  ```json
  {
    "version": 1,
    "projects": {
      "spec-service": {
        "last_sync_cursor": "01HXX...",
        "last_visit_cursor": "01HXX...",
        "last_full_sync": "2026-04-12T00:00:15Z",
        "last_pulled_at": "2026-04-12T00:00:15Z"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Written atomically after every pull and every `log --mark-read`. Add to `.gitignore` — it's per-clone state.

### `specs log` — new command

Stream audit events from the spec service for a project:

```bash
specs log <project>                          # 50 most recent events (desc)
specs log <project> --since 7d               # last 7 days
specs log <project> --since 2026-04-01       # since absolute date
specs log <project> --author bjorn@awolve.ai # filter by actor
specs log <project> --entity feature         # filter by entity type
specs log <project> --limit 200              # up to 1000
specs log <project> --json                   # machine-readable
specs log <project> --since-last-visit       # "what happened since I last looked"
specs log <project> --since-last-visit --mark-read  # advance the visit cursor
```

Output is colored by entity type (feature / doc / version / comment / review / bug / etc.), grouped by day, and shows actor + relative time. `--since-last-visit` reads the project's `last_visit_cursor` from the state file; `--mark-read` advances it to the newest event shown. Re-running the same command with `--mark-read` after a clean read shows "(no new events since your last visit)".

### Known soft limits

- `specs log --since <duration>` is a client-side filter applied after the server returns the window. The underlying endpoint is cursor-based (ULID), not timestamp-based, so the duration filter is a display convenience — for very old windows you'll need to paginate via `--limit`.
- `specs log --since-last-visit` relies on the state file's `last_visit_cursor`. First run with an empty state file returns everything the server has — expected, since "last visit" is undefined.

### Requires

- spec-service v0.18.0 or later. Older versions return the manifest without a `cursor` field, which the plugin tolerates but deletion detection + delta sync fall back to "full manifest every time".
## 0.13.0 — 2026-04-10
- **Binary attachments**. Completes the filesystem-sync half of the spec-service file upload feature (service side shipped in spec-service 0.13.0).
  - `pull` now also downloads feature attachments to the local feature folder alongside .md docs. Deduped by `(filename, size)` — re-downloads on size mismatch, skips otherwise.
  - New `attach` command and `/awolve-spec:attach` slash command for uploading a local binary file (image, PDF, Excel, etc.) to a feature. Feature is inferred from the file path if not specified explicitly.
  - Multipart upload built inline (no third-party deps) so the CLI stays stdlib-only.
- Requires spec-service v0.13.0 or later (earlier versions will reject the attachment API calls).

## 0.10.9 — 2026-04-02
- UX: API key login reads from clipboard (`--from-clipboard`) — copy key, run command, done
- Validates key starts with `sk_` before calling service
- Clears clipboard after successful login

## 0.10.8 — 2026-04-02

- Docs: added update command to README and SKILL.md
- Docs: updated README with full command list and current setup flow

## 0.10.5 — 2026-04-02
- UX: `/specs-login` now asks user to choose auth method (Azure CLI or API key) before proceeding

## 0.10.4 — 2026-04-02
- Security: API key login now uses `getpass` (hidden prompt) — key never appears in args or conversation
- Login verifies key against service before saving
- Command instructs user to run via `!` prefix so key stays in their terminal

## 0.10.3 — 2026-04-02

- Fix: create-doc now sends required `content` to API (was failing with 400)
- Fix: list-features reads `documentCount` instead of missing `documents` array
- Fix: frontmatter parsing tolerates BOM, `\r\n` line endings, and trailing whitespace
- Fix: push strips any leaked/double frontmatter from body before sending
- Fix: render_frontmatter normalizes body join to prevent double-newline compounding
- Refactor: create_backlog_item passes dict instead of pre-serialized JSON string

## 0.10.2 — 2026-04-01
- Fix: specs-pull updates local frontmatter (spec_version, feature_status, doc_status) when content matches but metadata has drifted — prevents stale base_version causing false 409 conflicts on push

## 0.10.1 — 2026-03-31
- Align marketplace and plugin versions

## 0.10.0 — 2026-03-31

## 0.9.0 — 2026-03-31
- Phased spec commands: `/spec requirements`, `/spec design`, `/spec infra`, `/spec plan`

## 0.8.1 — 2026-03-29
- Fix: register hooks in plugin manifest
