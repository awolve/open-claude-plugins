# /awolve-spec:rename-feature

Rename a feature folder and update the Signum record.

## Instructions

If the user didn't provide all arguments, ask:
1. Which project?
2. Which feature to rename?
3. What's the new name?

The number prefix is preserved — only the name part changes (e.g. `003-old-name` becomes `003-new-name`).

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/specs-cli.py rename-feature <project-id> <old-name> <new-name>
```

**Note:** This requires the rename endpoint on Signum. If it returns an error, the endpoint may not be deployed yet.
