# Specs Plugin

Spec-driven development workflow and sync with the Awolve Spec Service (specs.awolve.ai).

## Spec-driven development

If you're going to spec it, spec it properly. There is one spec format with three canonical files — use the ones that make sense for the feature.

### Canonical files

| File | Purpose | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `requirements.md` | What to build and why | When stakeholders need to approve the what |
| `design.md` | How to build it | Always — minimum viable spec |
| `plan.md` | Implementation breakdown | When the build needs a task breakdown |

These are the only spec document names. Other files in the folder are supporting material (diagrams, schemas) — only valid if referenced by one of the three.

### Commands — spec creation

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/awolve-spec:req` | Write `requirements.md` — push to service — stop for review |
| `/awolve-spec:design` | Write `design.md` — push — stop for review |
| `/awolve-spec:infra` | Enrich `design.md` with infrastructure details (SIGL-inspired) |
| `/awolve-spec:plan` | Write `plan.md` — push — ready to implement |
| `/awolve-spec:retro` | Document work after the fact (`design.md` + optional `plan.md`) |

Each phase is a separate command invocation. Do not write multiple spec files in one session unless the user explicitly asks.

### Flows

**Stakeholder-driven:** requirements → review → design → review → (infra) → plan → review → implement
**Self-directed:** design → (infra) → plan → implement
**Small feature:** design → implement
**No spec:** build it → optionally `/awolve-spec:retro`

### Closing a feature — run this checklist proactively

Implementation finished ≠ feature done. When the build wraps, close the loop without waiting for the user to ask "is it closed?":

1. **Docs match reality** — `design.md` and `plan.md` reflect what was actually built (update them, or `/awolve-spec:retro` if the work outran the spec). All plan tasks checked off.
2. **Shipped per the repo's ship cycle** — version bumped, branches synced, deployed and verified per the repo's `CLAUDE.md` ship & deploy section. A local-only "done" is not done.
3. **Statuses flipped** — feature → `completed` via `/awolve-spec:set-status`; related bugs → `resolved` with a closing `bug-comment` (commit SHA, version, rollout notes); doc review comments addressed and resolved via `resolve-comment`.
4. **Infra drift captured** — if infrastructure changed, update the project's SIGL files (see `handbook-context/engineering/architecture/sigl-spec.md`).

### Keep specs current mid-build

Specs track reality, not intentions. The moment a decision lands — in chat, in a meeting, in code — update the affected spec doc in the same session. Check off plan tasks as they complete. Never leave "is the spec updated?" as a question the user has to ask.

### Client visibility

Everything under the synced specs tree — including `specs/shared/` — is visible to clients on the portal for client projects. Never place internal-only material there (SIGL files, credentials, internal strategy, cost notes), and never rely on file extensions to keep something unexposed.

### Commands — sync and management

## specs-cli.py reference

Most slash commands wrap `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/specs-cli.py`. When a slash command does not exist for what you need, call the CLI directly — don't grep the script source and don't reach for the raw HTTP API. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/specs-cli.py --help` to confirm.

Full subcommand surface:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `pull [project-id] [--prune\|--keep] [--force-full]` | Pull latest specs |
| `push <file-path>` | Push a single spec file |
| `conflicts [project-id] [--json]` | List sync conflicts staged out-of-tree (per-machine cache) |
| `conflict show\|diff <doc>` | Inspect a staged conflict (`<doc>` = doc_id or local path) |
| `conflict resolve <doc> --theirs\|--mine\|--merged <file>` | Resolve a conflict: take remote, push local, or push a merged file |
| `cleanup-synced-tree [--dry-run] [--include-venv]` | Purge legacy in-tree sync/build artifacts (`.remote`, conflict copies, `.specs-trash/`, `_gen/.venv/`) |

| `set-description <feature-id> <text>` | Set or clear feature shortDescription |
| `set-title <feature-id> <text>` | Update a feature's display title without renaming the slug (separate from `rename-feature` which changes both name + title in one call) |
| `create-feature <project-id> <name> [--status] [--description]` | Create feature (service auto-assigns the number — do NOT include a numeric prefix in `<name>`) |
| `create-doc <project-id> <feature-name> <filename>` | Add a document to a feature |
| `rename-feature <project-id> <old> <new>` | Rename feature folder + service |
| `rename-doc <file-path> <new-filename>` | Rename a document |
| `delete-doc <file-path>` | Delete a document |
| `delete-feature <project-id> <feature-name>` | Delete a feature and its docs |
| `list-features <project-id>` | List all features in a project |
| `list-docs <project-id> <feature-name>` | List all docs in a feature |

| `view-bug <project-id> <bug-number> [--json]` | Full bug details |
| `bug <project-id> <title> <description> [severity] [--attach file ...]` | Report a bug |
| `update-bug <project-id> <bug-number> [--title T] [--description T] [--severity S]` | Edit a bug's title, description, or severity. For status changes use `set-bug-status`; to attach resolution notes prefer `bug-comment` so the original report stays intact. |
| `set-bug-status <project-id> <bug-number> <status>` | Change bug status (open/triaged/in_progress/ready_for_retest/resolved/closed) |
| `bug-comments <project-id> <bug-number> [--json]` | List the comment thread on a bug (oldest-first). Comment UUIDs shown in brackets so they can be passed to edit/delete commands. |
| `bug-comment <project-id> <bug-number> <body>` | Add a comment to a bug |
| `edit-bug-comment <project-id> <bug-number> <comment-id> <body>` | Edit a bug comment (author or internal user). Audited. |
| `delete-bug-comment <project-id> <bug-number> <comment-id>` | Delete a bug comment (author or internal user). Hard delete, audited. Confirm with user before calling — visible. |
| `edit-comment <comment-id> <body>` | Edit a spec-doc comment (author only). Audited (`comment.update`). |
| `delete-comment <comment-id>` | Delete a spec-doc comment (author only). Hard delete, audited. Confirm with user before calling — visible. |

| `reviews <file-path>` / `review <file-path> <verdict> [body]` | Read / submit reviews |
| `versions <file-path>` / `save <file-path> <summary>` | Version history / snapshot |
| `backlog [project-id] [--epics\|--flat] [--status STATUS] [--priority PRIORITY]` | List backlog items. Default = tree view (epic head + indented children). `--epics` filters to items where `isEpic = true` (including empty epics); `--flat` ignores hierarchy. |
| `backlog-add <project-id> <title> [description] [priority] [--parent <id-or-#N>] [--epic]` | Add a backlog item. `--parent` nests it under an existing epic (parent must have `isEpic = true`); `--epic` creates the item as an epic placeholder. The two flags are mutually exclusive. |
| `backlog-set-parent <project-id> <item-id-or-#N> <parent-id-or-#N\|none>` | Reparent an item (or pass `none` to detach). Errors include `parent_not_an_epic`, `parent_must_be_top_level`, `epic_has_children`, `child_cannot_be_epic`. |
| `backlog-update <project-id> <item-id-or-#N> [--title T] [--description T] [--priority P] [--status S]` | Update fields on an existing item. At least one flag required. For parent/epic changes use `backlog-set-parent`. |
| `backlog-delete <project-id> <item-id-or-#N>` | Soft-delete an item. If the item is an epic, the server cascades to all active children in one transaction. Confirm with the user before calling — destructive and visible in the portal. |
| `service-status` | Health check |
| `attach <file-path> [<project-id>/<feature-name>]` | Upload binary attachment |

Service base URL lives in `~/.claude-specs/config.yaml` (`service_url`). The portal UI is `<service_url>/portal/<project>/...` — useful for linking a user to a resource.

### Conventions when calling the CLI directly

- Pass `--json` where available (`comments`, `reviews`, `versions`, `log`, `view-bug`, `bug-comments`) when you need to parse output.
- Never pass a numeric prefix to `create-feature <name>` — the service rejects it with HTTP 500 and auto-numbers the feature anyway.
- Feature identifiers in URLs and subcommand arguments are the folder name (e.g. `030-terminal-resume-session`), not the UUID.

### Backlog hierarchy (epics)

Backlog items can be organized into one level of nesting: an **epic** (`isEpic: true`, top-level only) holds zero or more **child items** (regular items with `parentId` pointing at the epic). Epics are opt-in and explicit — created via `--epic` on `backlog-add` or via the portal modal. Empty epics are valid placeholders. Children can only be nested under explicit epics (not arbitrary top-level items).

When the user asks you to add **multiple related items** in one go (e.g. "add tasks for the onboarding flow"), prefer creating an epic first via `backlog-add … --epic` and then adding the rest with `--parent <epic-#N>`. This gives them a tidy tree view in the portal Backlog tab. For one-off items, leave them top-level.

## Important: Always pull before reading specs

**Before reading or working with spec files, always run `/awolve-spec:pull` first** to ensure you have the latest versions. The SessionStart hook handles this for new sessions, but mid-session you must pull manually.

Do not assume local spec files are current — pull first, then read.

## How it works

Spec files are synced from the spec service. Each synced file has YAML frontmatter with `spec_version`, `spec_doc_id`, and `last_synced`. On session start, latest specs are pulled. When you edit a spec file, it is automatically pushed.

## Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** There are two config files with different purposes:

| File | Purpose | Committed to git? |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `.claude/specs.md` | Shared project config — same for all team members | Yes |
| `.claude/specs.local.md` | Personal override — machine-specific paths | No (.gitignore) |

**Resolution order:** `specs.local.md` takes priority over `specs.md`. If `specs.local.md` exists, `specs.md` is ignored entirely.

### When to use which

**Use `.claude/specs.md` (committed) when:**
- Setting up a project repo — all devs share the same config
- The paths are the same for everyone (e.g. `./specs`)
- You want new team members to have config automatically after cloning

**Use `.claude/specs.local.md` (personal) when:**
- Paths are machine-specific (e.g. pointing to shared file storage)
- You need to override the committed config for your setup
- Testing or temporary config changes

### Config format

```yaml
---
service_url: https://specs.awolve.ai
projects:
  - id: project-name
    path: ./specs
---
```

Multi-project example:

```yaml
---
service_url: https://specs.awolve.ai
projects:
  - id: my-service
    path: path/to/my-service/specs
  - id: client-project
    path: path/to/client-project/specs
---
```

### Helping users set up config

When a user needs to set up specs config:

1. **Check if `.claude/specs.md` already exists** — if so, it may already work
2. **For single-project repos:** Create `.claude/specs.md` (committed) with `path: ./specs`
3. **For multi-project repos:** Create `.claude/specs.md` (committed) with appropriate paths
4. **Only create `.claude/specs.local.md`** if the user has a machine-specific path override
5. **Never create both** unless the user explicitly needs a personal override

Authentication is stored in `~/.claude-specs/auth.json` (per-machine, created by `/awolve-spec:login`).
